# Dev Log
## 24/02/2025 – 11/03/2025
All documents before this log were lost due too a file corruption. Files will now be saved to the pc and copied to external drives. Will also create a github folder for documentation. 
Up until now there was a proposal which is now being remade, the only documentation too survive was the Gannt chart which is still getting worked on. The game files are fine as an early prototype has been made with the rock throw ability and basic FPS controls from the FPS project have been ported over. 
Today a new proposal has been made it is like 70% done but still needs all the sketches to be remade for it that shouldn’t take long. Luckily I had these issues early than later.
